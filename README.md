This repository contains a disorganized collection of code for interacting with the arXiv, Scopus, Web of Science, MathSciNet, and Google Scholar.

Example use
===========

Producing all the text citations for an given article on Scopus:

    ./sbt "test:run-main net.tqft.scopus.TextCitationsFromIdentifierApp 2-s2.0-84867097056" | grep -v "\["

 (Here "2-s2.0-84867097056" is a typical Scopus article identifier. The grep command just cleans out junk from sbt, the scala build tool.)
